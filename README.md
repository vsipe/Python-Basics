- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vsipe
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Pandas, and automation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OOP, and other Python automation tasks. 
This is supposed to be a summary of what I'm working on, and can give me something to look back on as I am in the first steps of my Python journey.
